## I did it!

Time check: 12:09 mn. I'm typing this with a heavy head, half-closed eyes, and weary body - still, my heart is filled with joy that I have finally finished my grueling HTML course with FCC. Plus, I'm typing using my hella cool first-ever mechanical keyboard from 8Bitdo so I maybe sleepy but not tired.

I managed to make my own github stats generator today and used it in my own README.md. However, I'm still nowhere near the finish line about my project from Scratch. That'll be my priority tomorrow.

To do tomorrow:

- [] Draft my project from Scratch
- [] Dip my toes on the Odin Project
- [] Build beautiful things the fun way

Hell yeah! Let's GO GO GOOO!
