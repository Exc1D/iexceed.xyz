## Programming is also about the right mindset

The Odin Project opened my eyes about what it takes to be a developer. A solid foundation doesn't mean that you memorize the syntax and functions. It all boils down to how you approach something you don't know yet. Because the truth is coding is fun but it can easily burn you out and drown you in the sea of frustrations.

FOCUS

I need to be better mentally not intellectually. When the hard things come, will I still have the same enthusiasm solving it? I need to stick to a single game plan and pour my heart into it.

To do tomorrow:

- [ ] Fix the mockup site.
- [ ] Grind The Odin Project.
