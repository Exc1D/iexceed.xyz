## Progress is better than Perfect - always

I wasn't able to do everything on my checklist today because there were too much to learn and to try (which I did), I got no regrets tho.

I was able to give my blog and my github profile a well-deserved makeover. However, I wasn't able to finish the fCC (freeCodeCamp) HTML course though I made some progress. I think I can finish it tomorrow. Also, I wasn't able to make my project from Scratch but I will continue it tomorrow too.

I discovered a better figma alternative today which is Penpot. I had to install it using docker because the web app is so laggy, it's basically unusable. I got more to study now but that makes it more fun!

To do tomorrow:
[ ] Finish the HTML Course (please)
[ ] Make your project from Scratch
[ ] Study penpot

Day 4 done. LET'S GOOOOO!
