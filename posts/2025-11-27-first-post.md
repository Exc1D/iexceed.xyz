# Welcome to Exceed's first post

This demo post shows how content is authored in Markdown, stored under `posts/`, and rendered client-side using a small script and a Markdown parser (marked.js).

You can create new posts by adding `.md` files with the same frontmatter structure and updating `posts/index.json` (or use the provided helper script).
