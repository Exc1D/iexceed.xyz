##You really can't have it all

I thought today was supposed to be smooth-sailing for my coding journey. I've set up the perfect learning plan the crunched lectures and documentations. I powered through 5 HTML exercises today. I even mustered up the will to fix my Linkedin profile. Then a single phone call from an unknown phone number sent it all crumbling donw

I should've known better and provided a safety net for myself. The most precious things in the world are often the most fragile like trust. Trust, once broken, will never be the same. No amount of money can buy trust. Today, I've chosen not to trust a friend anymore. 🌹

"Life is full of plot twists. You think you have everything figured out, and then something unexpected happens. But that's what makes life interesting, right? We learn, we grow, and we adapt."

Day 3 of my Learning Plan is done. Even though my learning plan states that I should only complete 30% of fCC's HTML course, I managed to finish 90% of it. Since I''' build my personal page tomorrow, I might as well finish the HTML course too.

To do tomorrow:

- [ ] Finish Accessible HTML course
- [ ] Build my personal page
- [ ] Build my project from Scrath

Let's GO!!!
